# Analysis Service Test Suite

## Overview
Comprehensive test suite for the `AnalysisService` class following Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles.

## Test Coverage
- **89.29% Statement coverage**
- **79.16% Branch coverage** 
- **100% Function coverage**
- **91.2% Line coverage**

## Test Categories

### 1. Core Functionality Tests
- **Economic Insight Generation**: Tests the AI-powered insight generation for individual indicators
- **Economic Health Score Calculation**: Tests the weighted scoring system across 5 economic components
- **Correlation Analysis**: Tests smart correlation detection between indicator pairs

### 2. Mathematical Accuracy Tests
- **Pearson Correlation Calculation**: Validates mathematical accuracy with known data sets
- **Trend Analysis**: Tests linear regression-based trend detection (up/down/sideways)
- **Significance Assessment**: Tests category-specific thresholds for change significance

### 3. Data Validation Tests
- **Input Validation**: Ensures proper handling of insufficient or malformed data
- **Null/Undefined Handling**: Tests graceful degradation with missing values
- **Edge Case Handling**: Tests extreme values, zero values, and single data points

### 4. Performance Tests
- **Large Dataset Efficiency**: Ensures analysis completes within reasonable time limits
- **Data Limiting**: Tests that correlation analysis limits data points appropriately

### 5. Error Handling Tests
- **Database Connection Errors**: Tests graceful handling of database failures
- **Malformed Data**: Tests resilience to unexpected data formats
- **Invalid Calculations**: Tests handling of mathematical edge cases (division by zero, NaN)

### 6. Security Tests
- **AI Integration Security**: Ensures no sensitive information leaks in generated content
- **Input Sanitization**: Tests protection against injection attacks
- **Content Validation**: Ensures generated narratives are appropriate and professional

## Key Test Patterns

### Mock Factory Pattern
```typescript
const getMockIndicator = (overrides?: Partial<IndicatorData>): IndicatorData => ({
  id: 'test-indicator-1',
  name: 'Test Economic Indicator',
  category: 'employment',
  source: 'FRED',
  data: [/* default data */],
  ...overrides,
});
```

### Mathematical Validation
Tests use known mathematical relationships to validate calculation accuracy:
- Perfect positive correlation (r = 1.0)
- Perfect negative correlation (r = -1.0)
- Zero correlation with constant values
- Linear regression slope calculations

### Security Testing
- No API keys or sensitive configuration exposed in generated content
- Protection against SQL injection-style attacks
- Validation of narrative content quality and appropriateness

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all analysis service tests
npm test -- analysisService.test.ts

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage -- analysisService.test.ts

# Run in watch mode during development
npm run test:watch -- analysisService.test.ts
```

## Test Data Strategy

Tests use deterministic, predictable data patterns to ensure consistent results:
- **Correlation Tests**: Use aligned dates and predictable value patterns
- **Trend Tests**: Use clear upward/downward sequences
- **Edge Cases**: Test boundary conditions systematically

## Benefits

1. **Mathematical Reliability**: Ensures accurate financial calculations
2. **Business Logic Validation**: Confirms proper economic significance assessment
3. **Performance Assurance**: Validates efficient processing of large datasets
4. **Security Confidence**: Protects against data leaks and injection attacks
5. **Maintainability**: Provides safety net for future refactoring

## Future Enhancements

- Add tests for AI-powered forecasting features
- Expand correlation analysis with lag detection
- Add tests for seasonal adjustment calculations
- Include stress testing with real-world data volumes
